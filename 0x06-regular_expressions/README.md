This how i Have approached my tasks


1. **0. Simply matching School**:
   - **Task**: You need to create a regular expression that matches the word "School" exactly.
   - **Approach**: Use the provided Ruby script template and replace the regular expression part with `/School/`.
   - **Script**: Create a Ruby script (`0-simply_match_school.rb`) that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method.
   - **Testing**: Test the script with various inputs to ensure it correctly matches the word "School" in different contexts.

2. **1. Repetition Token #0**:
   - **Task**: Find a regular expression that matches certain patterns provided in the task description.
   - **Approach**: Analyze the patterns and come up with a regular expression that captures them all.
   - **Script**: Create a Ruby script (`1-repetition_token_0.rb`) that accepts one argument and uses the regular expression to match the provided patterns.
   - **Testing**: Test the script with inputs that match and don't match the expected patterns to verify its correctness.

3. **2. Repetition Token #1**:
   - **Task**: Similar to the previous task, find a regular expression that matches specific patterns provided in the task description.
   - **Approach**: Analyze the new patterns and adjust the regular expression accordingly.
   - **Script**: Develop a Ruby script (`2-repetition_token_1.rb`) similar to the previous one but using the new regular expression.
   - **Testing**: Test the script thoroughly to ensure it accurately matches the specified patterns.

4. **3. Repetition Token #2**:
   - **Task**: Once again, find a regular expression that matches certain patterns.
   - **Approach**: Analyze the new patterns and adjust the regular expression as needed.
   - **Script**: Create a Ruby script (`3-repetition_token_2.rb`) similar to the previous ones but using the updated regular expression.
   - **Testing**: Test the script to ensure it correctly matches the new patterns as specified.

5. **4. Repetition Token #3**:
   - **Task**: Find a regular expression that matches certain patterns without using square brackets.
   - **Approach**: Adjust the regular expression to match the provided patterns without relying on square brackets.
   - **Script**: Develop a Ruby script (`4-repetition_token_3.rb`) that follows the same structure but with the updated regular expression.
   - **Testing**: Test the script with inputs to confirm it correctly matches the specified patterns.

6. **5. Not quite HBTN yet**:
   - **Task**: Create a regular expression and a script to match strings starting with 'h', ending with 'n', and having any single character in between.
   - **Approach**: Craft a regular expression that captures the required pattern.
   - **Script**: Develop a Ruby script (`5-beginning_and_end.rb`) that accepts an argument and uses the regular expression to match the specified pattern.
   - **Testing**: Test the script with various inputs to ensure it accurately identifies strings that meet the criteria.

7. **6. Call me maybe**:
   - **Task**: Design a regular expression and a script to match 10-digit phone numbers.
   - **Approach**: Create a regular expression that precisely matches 10-digit phone numbers.
   - **Script**: Develop a Ruby script (`6-phone_number.rb`) that accepts an argument and uses the regular expression to identify 10-digit phone numbers.
   - **Testing**: Test the script with different phone number formats to verify its correctness.

8. **7. OMG WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?**:
   - **Task**: Craft a regular expression and a script to match capital letters only.
   - **Approach**: Design a regular expression that identifies sequences of capital letters.
   - **Script**: Create a Ruby script (`7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb`) that accepts an argument and uses the regular expression to extract capital letters.
   - **Testing**: Test the script with various inputs to ensure it correctly identifies and extracts capital letters.

9. **8. Textme (Advanced)**:
   - **Task**: Write a script to extract sender, receiver, and flags information from log entries based on a specific format.
   - **Approach**: Use regular expressions to parse the log entries and extract the required information.
   - **Script**: Develop a Ruby script (`100-textme.rb`) that processes log entries and outputs sender, receiver, and flags information.
   - **Testing**: Test the script with provided log entries to ensure it accurately extracts the required information.
