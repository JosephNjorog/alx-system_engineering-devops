To tackle each task in the Networking Basics Project,this is waht ive done below..

1. **0. OSI model**:
   - **Task**: Understand the OSI model, its layers, and organization.
   - **Approach**: Learn about the OSI model's layers from the lowest (physical) to the highest (application).
   - **Script**: Write a Bash script (`0-OSI_model`) that answers questions about the OSI model, such as its definition and organization.
   - **Testing**: Test the script with the provided questions to ensure accurate understanding and responses.

2. **1. Types of network**:
   - **Task**: Understand different types of networks like LAN, WAN, and the Internet.
   - **Approach**: Learn the characteristics of LAN, WAN, and the Internet.
   - **Script**: Create a Bash script (`1-types_of_network`) to answer questions about LAN, WAN, and Internet connectivity.
   - **Testing**: Validate the script's responses to ensure it correctly identifies the types of networks based on the given scenarios.

3. **2. MAC and IP address**:
   - **Task**: Understand MAC and IP addresses.
   - **Approach**: Learn the definitions and purposes of MAC and IP addresses.
   - **Script**: Develop a Bash script (`2-MAC_and_IP_address`) to answer questions regarding MAC and IP addresses.
   - **Testing**: Verify the script's responses to ensure it accurately describes MAC and IP addresses.

4. **3. UDP and TCP**:
   - **Task**: Differentiate between TCP and UDP.
   - **Approach**: Understand the characteristics and use cases of TCP and UDP.
   - **Script**: Write a Bash script (`3-UDP_and_TCP`) to answer questions about TCP and UDP protocols.
   - **Testing**: Test the script to ensure it provides correct explanations for the characteristics of TCP and UDP.

5. **4. TCP and UDP ports**:
   - **Task**: Understand TCP and UDP ports and their significance.
   - **Approach**: Learn about commonly used ports like SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
   - **Script**: Develop a Bash script (`4-TCP_and_UDP_ports`) that displays listening ports and associated programs.
   - **Testing**: Execute the script to verify it accurately lists listening ports along with their corresponding programs.

6. **5. Is the host on the network**:
   - **Task**: Understand the use of ICMP and the ping command.
   - **Approach**: Learn how ping works to check host connectivity.
   - **Script**: Create a Bash script (`5-is_the_host_on_the_network`) that pings an IP address passed as an argument.
   - **Testing**: Test the script with valid and invalid IP addresses to ensure it accurately performs the ping operation and displays results.

By completing these tasks, i have gained a solid understanding of networking basics, including the OSI model, types of networks, addressing, protocols, and network troubleshooting tools.
