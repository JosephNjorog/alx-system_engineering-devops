To rename a file using SSH, you can use the mv (move) command. Here's how you can do it:

Connect to the Server:
Connect to your server using SSH.

bash
Copy code
ssh username@hostname
Replace username with your username and hostname with the IP address or hostname of your server. Enter your password when prompted.

Navigate to the Directory:
Change to the directory where the file is located.

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/directory
Replace path/to/directory with the actual path to the directory containing the file.

Rename the File:
Use the mv command to rename the file. The syntax is:

bash
Copy code
mv old_filename new_filename
In your case:

bash
Copy code
mv 0-first_9_tasks 0-first_9_tasks.png
Replace 0-first_9_tasks with the current filename and 0-first_9_tasks.png with the desired new filename.

If your file is in a different directory, you'll need to provide the full path:

bash
Copy code
mv /path/to/directory/0-first_9_tasks /path/to/directory/0-first_9_tasks.png
Exit SSH:
After renaming the file, you can exit the SSH session.

bash
Copy code
exit
This will effectively rename the file. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to perform the rename operation in the specified directory.

summary of how to add screenshots to my github using SFTP
ChatGPT
Adding screenshots to your GitHub repository using SFTP involves a series of steps. Here's a summary:

Capture Screenshots:
Capture the screenshots you want to add to your GitHub repository and save them on your local machine.

Connect to SFTP Server:
Use the sftp command to connect to your SFTP server. Replace username with your SFTP username and hostname with the server's IP address or hostname.

bash
Copy code
sftp username@hostname
Enter your password when prompted.

Navigate to Repository Directory:
Change to the directory where your GitHub repository is located on the server.

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/your/repository
Upload Screenshots:
Use the put command to upload the screenshots from your local machine to the server.

bash
Copy code
put local_screenshot.png
Replace local_screenshot.png with the actual filename of your screenshot.

Exit SFTP:
After uploading the screenshots, exit the SFTP session.

bash
Copy code
exit
Commit Changes in Git:
If your GitHub repository is version-controlled with Git, you need to commit the changes.

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Add screenshots"
git push
Replace the commit message accordingly.

Verify on GitHub:
Visit your GitHub repository on the web to verify that the screenshots have been added. They should be visible in the repository's file list.

Remember to replace placeholders such as username, hostname, local_screenshot.png, and /path/to/your/repository with your actual information.

Please note that while SFTP can be used to transfer files, it's not the typical method for managing a Git repository. If your project is hosted on GitHub, consider using Git commands or the GitHub web interface for version control. The steps above assume you have direct SFTP access to your server where the repository is located. If you are using a service like GitHub, you would typically clone the repository to your local machine, add the screenshots, commit changes, and push them to GitHub.
